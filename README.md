## Features
In this project I developed a simple event app with authentication:

- The form uses Bootstrap library for css combined with embedded ruby code
- The back end is set up with User,Transaction and Group models that validates presence of username,password,transaction title,transaction amount. These models also contains different associations between each other.
- I incorporated devise gem for user's authentication and corresponding actions such as Log in, Log out,Sign up.
- If user check the page without being authenticated, he/she will not be able to see any functionalities. Once user do the login then he/she can use all the functionalities of the app.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can create their own transactions and groups.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can track their grouped and non grouped transactions.
- Transactions view pages displays transaction it's title, date and amount.
- Both group and non group transaction view page display the total amount of transaction.
- group show page displays all the associated transactions with the name of transaction author.
